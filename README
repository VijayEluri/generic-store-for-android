NOTE: this branch contains impl of pre-2012!!!

GenericStore aims to abstract usage of ObjectCache and SharedPreferences.

I'm using this impl for LOCO8, FotoFeed, MayorMonster, CheckInNINJA and ongoing Android apps -> works like a charm! :-)

p.s. I made use of Droid-Fu caching (https://github.com/kaeppler/droid-fu), 
which was covering Image caching, I extended into using generic object caching too.

clone the project from github, then import as "library", after that it is easy to include in your projects.


TODO: I'll add some example code as soon as possible, in meantime feel free to ping me if you need any help
