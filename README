GenericStore aims to abstract usage of ObjectCache and SharedPreferences.

I'm using this impl for FotoLIcKE, MayorMonster and ongoign Android apps -> works like a charm! :-)

p.s. I made use of Droid-Fu caching (https://github.com/kaeppler/droid-fu), 
which was covering Image caching, I extended into using generic object caching too.
