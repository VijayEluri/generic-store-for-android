I made use of Droid-Fu caching (https://github.com/kaeppler/droid-fu), 
which was covering Image caching, I extended into using generic object caching too.

GenericStore aims to abstract usage of ObjectCache and SharedPreferences.

note: I used similar structure for FotoLIcKE.com , and works like a charm.
