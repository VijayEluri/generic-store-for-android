NOTE:  
master contains latest updates and changes!!!!   
/demo-example contains a project example for sample usage of generic-store    
            
if you want the older version of the library, you should switch to branch "pre-2012"       
     
GenericStore is an abstraction library for easier & simpler usage of ObjectCache and SharedPreferences.
    
I'm using this impl for LOCO8, MayorMonster, FotoFeed, CheckInNINJA and ongoing Android apps -> works like a charm! :-)

p.s. I made use of Droid-Fu caching (https://github.com/kaeppler/droid-fu), 
which was covering Image caching, I extended into using also generic Object caching!    

clone the project from github, then import as "library", after that it is easy to include in your projects.
    
   
Contributions are welcome!   

TODO: I'll add some example code as soon as possible, in meantime feel free to ping me if you need any help
